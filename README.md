The Foodr application is similar to the application "Tinder" but for recipes.

The main page presents a recipe and the user can swipe to the right to save it to their "Cookbook" or to the left to see a new receipe. Alternatively, they can click the icons underneath the image in lieu of swiping - the heart icon and "X" respectively. The recipes presented are from an API (https://www.themealdb.com/) and can be filtered at the users selection.

The "Cookbook" contains the saved recipes by the user. The recipes can be viewed in full for preparation and removed from the "Cookbook."

The application also contains a meal planner where users can take their saved recipes and plan out when they would like the prepare them.

The application was created in React Native. For demoing purposes, the current version does not connect with a database and the application will remove and saved information upon reloading.
